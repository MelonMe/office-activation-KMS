KMS Stand for Key Management Service server.For those of you guys who don’t know about it, KMS server is used to help people (who love to get things for free) to get 180-day Office license for FREE. And don’t worry about expiration date because you still can renew the license and so on. It can be said that if the server is maintained, license period can last indefinitely. Recently there are a lot of free KMS servers shared on the internet and they are ready for use anytime.

I have pasted some cmd app just download according to your office version and run as admin (Internet Required).
